<h1>CS 136 Assignment 8</h1>

<p>Due Wednesday, July 15 at 5:30 PM sharp.
<p>Please read the preamble in <a href="../a1/preamble.shtml">Assignment 1</a>.
<p>Only the C language features introduced up to <strong>section 10</strong> are allowed.
<hr>
<p>In your code, you do NOT have to check that the value returned from <tt>malloc</tt> (or <tt>realloc</tt>) is invalid (NULL).
<p>You may assume that all C strings are null terminated: you do not have to assert this (and it's not possible to).
<p>If a requirement is that a structure is "valid", you may assume this, and you do are not required to to assert it.  If the structure is passed as a pointer you should still assert that the pointer itself is not NULL.
<p>For full marks you must satisfy (or exceed) the specified running times.
<hr>
<strong><p>Note: For Problems 0a and 1, you are NOT allowed to use the <tt>string.h</tt> library (module).</strong>
<hr>
<h3>Assignment 8 Problem 0. <i>[10 Marks correctness]</i></h3>
<strong>Problem 0 is a "warm-up" question.  You are allowed to collaborate with your fellow classmates and discuss the solution on piazza.</strong>

<ol type="a">

  <li>[1 mark] Write the C module <tt>strdup.c</tt> that implements the <tt>my_strdup</tt> function described in Module 10 slide 21.  Unlike the version on slide 21 you may not use any <tt>string.h</tt> functions (such as strlen and strcpy).  Do not write helpers, either.  Your implementation must have a running time of O(n) where n is the length of the string <tt>s</tt>.
  <tt>char *my_strdup(const char *s);</tt><br><br>
  
  <li>[2 marks] Write the C module <tt>posn.c</tt> that provides the <tt>make_posn</tt> function described in <a href="posn.h"><tt>posn.h</tt></a>.<br><br>
    
  <li>[2 marks] In this question you will revisit the manifests from A6.  Write the C module <tt>reservation.c</tt> that provides the functions described in <a href="reservation.h"><tt>reservation.h</tt></a>.<br><br>
  
  <li>[5 marks] Write a C module <tt>readstr.c</tt> that implements a "safe" version of the <tt>gets</tt> function called <tt>readstr</tt> (see <a href="readstr.h"><tt>readstr.h</tt></a> for details).<br><br>

  Your function must repeatedly call <tt>scanf</tt> until a newline or EOF is encountered.  The returned string must NOT include the EOF or newline.  The returned array must have a length equal to the length of the string plus 1 (for the null terminator).  Your function must have a running time of O(n) where n is the number of characters read.  You may assume that all of the characters you read (except for newline) will be in the visible range (ASCII values 32..126).<br><br>
TIP: use a "doubling dynamic array" strategy to achieve the O(n) (amoritzed) running time.  You will likely require multiple calls to <tt>realloc</tt>, including one call to set the final (correct) size.  You can choose any initial dynamic array size you'd like (e.g., 1, 16, 64...).<br><br>
We have included an interactive text program that will read a line from the user, and then print the length of that line as well as the first and last characrters of the string (or {empty string} if the string is the empty string).  The reason it does this rather than printing the entire string is that it can be hard to tell the difference between readstr being slow, and printf being slow.
<br/><br/>
The test program can be found in <a href="test-readstr.c"><tt>test-readstr.c</tt></a>.  We have included a very large input file in <a href="alice.in"><tt>alice.in</tt></a> and the expected output when this input is given to the test program is in <a href="alice.expect"><tt>alice.expect</tt></a>.

<h3>Assignment 8 Problem 1. <em>[10 Marks <strong>for correctness</strong>.</em><i>]</i></h3>

Write a C module <tt>strappend.c </tt>that implements a <tt>strappend</tt> function (see <a href="strappend.h"><tt>strappend.h</tt></a> for details).<br><br>
<strong>NOTE: For this question, you cannot use <tt>string.h</tt></strong><br><br>

<em>Public test sample:</em>
<p><tt>strappend("hello","world")</tt> returns the new string <tt>"helloworld"</tt>
<hr>

<h3>
<p>Assignment 8 Problem 2. <em>[10 Marks <strong>for correctness</strong>.</em><i>]</i></h3>
<p>Write a  C module <tt> afilter.c </tt>that provides the abstract array function <tt>afilter</tt>.  See the interface file <a href="afilter.h">afilter.h</a> for more details.
<br /><br />
  <em>Public test sample:</em> <br>
  for a dynamic array da of length 6: <tt>(4 8 15 16 23 42)</tt><br>
  and the following function:<br>
  <tt>bool is_even(int n) { return n % 2 == 0; }</tt><br>
  then, <tt>afilter(da, is_even)</tt> would modify da to be of length 4: <tt>(4 8 16 42)</tt><br>
<hr>
<h3>
<p>Assignment 8 Problem 3. <em>[15 Marks <strong>for correctness</strong>.</em><i>]</i></h3>

Write a program <tt>skipints.c</tt> that reads in a sequence of positive integers using <tt>scanf("%d", &i)</tt> until a 0 is encountered (you can assume only positive integers will be entered in the sequence, and no EOF is encountered).  The program then reads in a final positive integer <tt>k</tt>.  The program then prints <strong>every k-th</strong> integer from the original sequence of integers.  Each integer printed is followed by a newline.  The running time of your program must be O(n), where n is the number of integers read.<br><br>
Examples: If k is 1, it prints the full sequence of integers.  If k is 2, it prints every other integer, ignoring the first, third, etc.  If k is equal to the length of the sequence, it prints out the last integer.  If k is larger than the length of the sequence, then no integers are printed out.

  input:<br>
  4 8 15 16 23 42 0 2<br>
  output:<br>
  8<br>

<h3>
<p>Assignment 8 Problem 4. <em>[25 Marks <strong>for correctness</strong>, 10 Marks <strong>hand-marking</strong>.</em><i>]</i></h3>
<p>Write a  C module <tt> aos.c </tt> for managing an array of strings.  See the interface file <a href="aos.h">aos.h</a> for more details.<br /><br />

An array of strings is really an array of <tt> char </tt> pointers, where each pointer can then point to a string.<br><br>

  <em>Public test sample:</em> <br>
<code>
struct aos *a = create_aos(10);<br>
assert(aos_get(a,5) == NULL);<br>
aos_set(a,"apple",5);<br>
assert(strcmp(aos_get(a,5),"apple") == 0);<br>
assert(aos_add(a,"zebra") == 0);<br>
aos_sort(a);<br>
assert(strcmp(aos_get(a,0),"apple") == 0);<br>
assert(strcmp(aos_get(a,1),"zebra") == 0);<br>
destroy_aos(a);<br>
</code>

<h3>
<p>Assignment 8 Problem 5. <em>[20 Marks <strong>for correctness</strong>.</em><i>]</i></h3>

In this question, you will see a technique for storing a Binary Search Tree (BST) in an array.  We will use the following rules:

<ul>
<li>The root of the tree is stored at index 0 of the array (i.e., a[0])
<li>For a node at index k, its left child is stored at index (2*k + 1) and its right child is stored at index (2*k + 2)
<li>If a node is empty, we will store a special "sentinal" value in the array.  For this question, we will use INT_MIN (-2147483648).
</ul>

Consider the following BST:<br>

<img src="bst1.png" /> <br>

It would be stored in the following array (blanks would contain INT_MIN):<br>
<table border="1" style="text-align:right;border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td>index<td>0<td>1<td>2<td>3<td>4<td>5<td>6<td>7<td>8<td>9<td>10<td>11<td>12<td>13<td>14<td>15<td>16<td>...</tr>
<td>value<td>5<td>3<td>10<td>-6<td><td>7<td>12<td><td><td><td><td><td><td><td>42<td><td><td></tr>
</table>


<p>Write a  C module <tt> atree.c </tt> for managing a BST in an array.  See the interface file <a href="atree.h">atree.h</a> for more details.  In particular, note that the array <b>must</b> always have a length of 2<sup>maxheight</sup>.<br /><br />
